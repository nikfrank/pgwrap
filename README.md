pgx odm for node- postgres (npm pg)
===

install::

    npm install pgx


docs:

boot process:

    var pg = require('pg');
    var pgx = require('pgx')(pg, config.connection, schemas);

config.connection is for pg and is formatted as follows:

    {
    	conop:{
    	    user: 'nik',
    	    password: 'niksPassword',
    	    database: 'niksDatabase',
    	    host: 'localhost',
    	    port: 5432
    	}
    }

schemas can be extended as you please and passed around, they look like this:

    {
        defaultFields:{
    	    hash:{
    	        type:'varchar(31)',
    	        permissions:''
    	    },
    	    xattrs:{
    	        type:'json',
    	        defval:{}
    	    }
        },
        db:{
    	    domsnap:{
    	        tableName:'niks_things',
    	        fields:{
    		    whatever:{
    		        type:'json'
    		    },
    		    created:{
    		        type:'timestamp'
    		    }
    	        }
    	    }
        }
    }

This needs better documentation, and to stop using keys as values. sorry.

the type field is a postgres type

defval is a default value. yeah, I could've used camel case. sorry.

there's also the ability to define join types, which store a hash to join to.

that needs documentation

also, the default fields are very caked into everything, so at some point they'll cease 
to be optional

also, default types are prefixed with the schemaName, which is the key in the db object

db.boot

    pgx.boot({}, function(a){res.json(a);});

I put this in a get route, run it on update, then push the code again without the route
it should be idempotent, but I don't really trust it

there's probably a better solution (like checking and updating on require)

I think there's some options like if data should be retained, and there's gonna be
something like "data map" in case you changed the name of something.


pgx gives you:


pg.read(schemaNameOrNames, queryParams, options, callback(err,data))

pg.upsert(schemaNameOrNames, queryParams, options, callback(err,data))

pg.insert(schemaNameOrNames, queryParams, options, callback(err,data))

on the original pg object. unconventional? probably.

in addition to the original pg.connect -> client -> query -> ... routine

+ stringOnly option

** check these siggies. I'm doing this from memory **

** also document the options in each one **

** talk about how the xattrs field makes this feel like mongo **

** catchies:: 'group' 'user' **

** default fields, values **

** join type **

** options.returning **

"order by" type queries

limit queries

json depth filters (where json->'key'='val')

insertBatch (array of inserted objects)

todo

batchInsert verify totals

pgboot using batch insert

data verify

document return types:

insert (1 record, json)
upsert (array of objects updated)
read (array of objects read)

...

write some tests::

empty boot db

insert some records

read those records

update the records

batch insert some records --> need in testdata.js

json-depth read

((join read))

limit & sorted reads

((erase some records))

((verifySchema))

----------------
todo:
----------------


schema verify schema cannot have anything called "group" or "user" or starting with a $

range queries

- regexps for strings

- range or modulo for numbers

diffs as a data type/schema option

array and json operators

- contains, not contains, contains at least N of [...]

- dereferenced array & object

'authors[0].name':{$like:'%Frank'}
'authors[2:5].name':{$like:'%Frank'}
'authors.name':{$like:'%Frank'}
'authors':{name:{$like:'%Frank'},location:'tel aviv'}
'authors':{$elemMatch:{name:{$like:'%Frank'},location:'tel aviv'} }
...
implement the useful parts of mongo syntax

this may involve writing actual psql routines and saving them from pg.boot
------------------------------

make xattrs and hash default behaviour, move them out of defaultsFields
this is just part of the odm. don't like it? don't use pgx

------------------------------

transferring data in the instance of non-compatible type change

write tests & format for node module

writing into json

json updates are done as read+ write in psql 9.3

update in one query?

congratulations! you made it to the bottom. this is a lot of work.
